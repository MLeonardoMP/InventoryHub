# Full-Stack Integration Capstone Project

A modern full-stack application demonstrating the integration of Blazor WebAssembly frontend with ASP.NET Core minimal API backend, developed as part of the Microsoft Fullstack Developer course on Coursera.

## Features

### Frontend (Blazor WebAssembly)

- **Product Catalog Display**: Interactive product listing with category information
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Bootstrap for a responsive design that works on any device
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular, reusable Blazor components
- **Efficient Data Binding**: Seamless integration with backend API data
- **Loading State Handling**: Improved user experience during data fetching operations

### Backend (ASP.NET Core Minimal API)

- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Clean, modern API design using minimal API syntax
- **Multi-Layer Caching Strategy**:
  - In-memory cache with custom expiration policies
  - HTTP response caching with appropriate cache headers
  - Output caching for optimized response delivery
- **CORS Configuration**: Secure cross-origin resource sharing setup
- **OpenAPI Integration**: API documentation and testing support

### Performance Optimizations

- **Memory Caching**: Reduces database hits for frequently accessed product data
- **Sliding Expiration**: Cache entries remain valid while in active use
- **Cache Prioritization**: High-priority caching for critical data
- **HTTP Caching Headers**: Browser-level caching for improved performance
- **Conditional Rendering**: Efficient UI updates only when needed

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the Server directory and run: `dotnet run`
3. Navigate to the client directory and run: `dotnet run`
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5274` to see the application
